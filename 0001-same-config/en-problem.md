To ensure that your server configuration has all the prerequisites to run Symfony2, you must run the `check.php` files.

One from the cli:

```sh
$ php app/check.php
```

One from the web (as you know, PHP configuration can be different between cli and web):

```sh
firefox http://localhost/web/config.php
```
